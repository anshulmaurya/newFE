Let me provide you with a comprehensive database architecture plan for your embedded systems learning platform. This architecture will ensure all your website features are properly integrated with your database.

Database Architecture Plan for DSPCoder
1. Current Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
Your application is already using a PostgreSQL database with the following tables:

Core Tables
users: User authentication and profile information
problems: Embedded systems coding challenges and exercises
user_progress: Tracks user progress on individual problems
user_stats: Stores aggregated statistics for each user
user_activity: Records daily user activity (for streak tracking)
session: Manages user sessions for authentication

2. Proposed Enhancements
Based on the features I've identified in your codebase, here's a comprehensive database architecture to ensure all aspects of your application are covered:

Authentication & User Management
Existing: users, session
New Tables:
user_preferences: Store user interface preferences, notification settings
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK to users)
- theme (light/dark)
- notification_settings (JSON)
- editor_preferences (JSON)
- created_at, updated_at
Learning Content & Problems
Existing: problems

New Tables:
problem_categories: Normalized table for categories
- id (PK)
- name (Memory Management, Multithreading, etc.)
- slug
- description
- icon_path
- order (for display order)

learning_paths: Predefined sequences of problems
- id (PK)
- title
- description
- difficulty
- estimated_hours
- category_id (FK)
- created_at, updated_at
learning_path_items: Problems in learning paths
- id (PK)
- learning_path_id (FK)
- problem_id (FK)
- order
- required (boolean)

Company-Specific Preparation
New Tables:
companies: Store information about companies (Apple, Nvidia, Tesla)
- id (PK)
- name
- logo_url
- description
- interview_focus (text)
company_problem_map: Links problems to specific companies
- company_id (FK)
- problem_id (FK)
- relevance_score (1-10)

User Progress & Learning
Existing: user_progress, user_stats, user_activity
New Tables:
learning_path_progress: Track progress on learning paths
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- learning_path_id (FK)
- started_at
- completed_at
- completion_percentage
- active (boolean)

user_notes: Personal notes per problem
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- problem_id (FK)
- content (text)
- created_at, updated_at

Community & Interaction
New Tables:
discussions: Forum/discussion threads
- id (PK)
- title
- content
- user_id (FK)
- problem_id (FK, optional)
- category (general, help, etc.)
- created_at, updated_at
discussion_replies: Responses to discussions
- id (PK)
- discussion_id (FK)
- user_id (FK)
- content
- like
- dislike
- parent_reply_id (FK, self-referencing for nested replies)
- created_at, updated_at

user_achievements: Badges and achievements
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- achievement_type (streak, problem_count, etc.)
- level (bronze, silver, gold)
- earned_at

3. Database Relationships
Key relationships to implement:

One user has many problem attempts, notes, and achievements
Problems belong to categories
Learning paths contain multiple problems in a specific order
Companies are associated with relevant problems
Discussions can be linked to specific problems
