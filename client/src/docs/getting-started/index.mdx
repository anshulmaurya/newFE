## Skills Needed for Embedded Systems Development

Embedded systems development requires a combination of hardware and software skills:

- **C/C++ Programming** - The foundation of most embedded systems
- **Microcontroller Architecture** - Understanding CPU cores, memory systems, and peripherals
- **Digital Logic** - Building blocks of all digital systems
- **Communication Protocols** - How devices talk to each other (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, etc.)
- **Real-Time Operating Systems** - Managing tasks and resources efficiently
- **Debugging Techniques** - Finding and fixing problems in embedded systems
