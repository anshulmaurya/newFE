# Introduction to Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.

## Why Study Embedded Systems?

Embedded systems are at the heart of modern technology:

- They power IoT devices, automotive control systems, and medical devices
- They provide the intelligence for smart homes and industrial automation
- They enable portable computing devices and wearable technology

## Embedded Systems in Technical Interviews

Many companies test embedded systems knowledge during technical interviews, including:

- Device driver implementation
- Interrupt handling and prioritization
- Memory management and optimization
- Real-time operating system concepts
- Communication protocols
- Hardware/software interfaces

## Key Challenges in Embedded Development

Embedded systems development comes with unique challenges:

- **Resource Constraints**: Limited processing power, memory, and energy
- **Real-time Requirements**: Meeting strict timing deadlines
- **Reliability**: Systems often must operate for years without failing
- **Hardware Integration**: Working directly with hardware components
- **Safety and Security**: Protecting systems from physical and cyber threats
